# ACEP_BRED_2025


HI SO
THIS DIDNT WORK REALLY
I WILL TROUBLESHOOT IT LATER. GOING THE TO BED
CHECK THE OTHER TAB IT DID WORK IN BROSWER I KINDA THINK IT JUST NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SCROLL RIGHT HAHA
BUT I WANT IT TO FORMAT A SPREADSHEET NOT CREATE A SPREADSHEET OUT OF TEXT BUT WHATEVER
I typed all that and then fixed it by going top right and clicking no wrap but that doesnt solve problem one line above

As with all other data, this is per patient and per physician/extender.<br><br>This includes tracking board time when the patient is selected and the display shows additional information about the patient. Time on the tracking board with no additional clinical patient data shown (e.g. hover, sidebar, etc) is attributed to “Tracking Board” and recorded as such. For ambient recording, this does include setup time and usage of the results. It does not include time when ambient is used just to record (i.e. listen) without additional user input.<br><br>We suggest including a time period since the last user input. For example, including 5 seconds of time since last user input when there is a period of inactivity lasting at least 15 seconds.<br><br>Suggested metadata:<br>M1: # mouse clicks<br>M2: # keypresses<br>M3: # function keys used<br>M4: # macros invoked<br>M5: # inactive times included<br>M6: # minutes used in patient room<br>M7: # minutes used remotely (e.g. home, coffee shop) | Our goal for this measure was to quantify the total effort required to perform EHR-related tasks. Burden corresponds to effort which is hard to quantify. So, we chose total EHR time is a surrogate for effort. Total time in the EHR is a function of the patient, illness, institution, physician, care role, and many other factors.<br><br>This directly complements ACEP QM ED Arrival-to-Departure (ACEP50) which tracks overall encounter length and is part of CEDR reporting. Pairing “provider EHR time per encounter” with ACEP50 may identify helpful relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | We encourage creation of additional measures that incorporate facial recognition or eye-tracking software to use a combination of time spent looking at the screen and at which data.

Quantification of MDM content would be a challenging goal. This may include phrase macros (e.g., smartphrases, autotext) used for justification of actions and processes.<br><br>Recommendations mentioned in Genes's Note bloat article might be of value to improve this measure.

Some in other specialties have called this “pajama time”. We debated how much time after shift completion is reasonable to stay to complete documentation and concluded that any additional time is an uncompensated burden whether it be at work or at home.<br>Additionally, as some physicians might stay to complete documentation while others go home or even return, we thought this burden should be measured equally given that this workflow is a personal choice.<br><br>This metric corresponds to those of Sinsky et al in "Metrics for assessing physician activity using electronic health record log data" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32027360/)<br>Regardless, many believe this to be an indication of burnout and as we study this, it may be worth looking at as a well-being indicator for physicians and a quality measure for hospitals. | We encourage vendors to consider including data such as number of charts completed after hours, % or documentation content, or other measures they believe might be useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

We wanted to do this without imposing an additional survey burden on the typical feedback process. We recognize that the content of feedback is a measure of perception, which has validity but is difficult to compare given its many contributing factors. Ultimately we felt that measuring the amount of user feedback indicated engagement and would hopefully correspond with response to feedback.<br><br>We considered measuring the response to feedback but felt this was currently too aspirational and was often poorly recorded. Instead we included this as a metadata value. Use of this metadata (M2) may provide evidence of compliance with an "Improvement Activity" under MIPS.<br>                         | We would like to someday have a measure of “technostress”, which refers to the stressful impact of technology in the workplace. This might require facial recognition or other technologies currently only used in research settings.<br>Another alternative considered was a simple option in the corner of the screen to click on a happy face or a sad face to indicate one’s satisfaction with the EHR at that moment. This could include an option to comment.<br>Although validated and very useful, we chose not to proscribe use of the KLAS Net EHR experience score as this an similar scales add user burden and may not be specific enough.                                                                             |

Since some of this time isn't assigned to a specific patient but other times can be, we felt a specific measure of this would be most appropriate. Due to some of the tracking board tasks including data review, this time overlaps with other time fields. Use of metadata fields can eliminate this overlap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Several aspiration items should be considered which affect user experience. This could allow EHR vendors to target consistent issues that should be either avoided or encouraged. For example, the number of minutes with something blinking. Another example might be the percent of time with tracking board patients hidden by the need to scroll..<br><br>There is some thought of separating tracking board use into (1) individual patient use and (2) overall department analysis. Methods for doing this will require additional work.<br><br>This is an area that would benefit from eye tracking data as there is such a high density of visual data.                                                                     |
