# ACEP_BRED_2025
The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) produced the Burdent Reduction for Emergency Departments (BRED) standard to help identify and measure workforce burden.  The aprroved standard definitions are documented here.  There are 12 top level standards. They are BRED1-BRED13 (omitting #7) with approximately 70 secondary measures.
To view more detail, see [the expanded table](https://github.com/jeffnielson/ACEP_BRED_2025/blob/jeffnielson-patch-1/EXPANDEDTABLE.md) which contains supportive tesxt and aspirational comments.

Time on the tracking board with no additional clinical patient data shown (e.g. hover, sidebar, etc) is attributed to “Tracking Board” and recorded as such. For ambient recording, this does include setup time and usage of the results. It does not include time when ambient is used just to record (i.e. listen) without additional user input.<br><br>We suggest including a time period since the last user input. For example, including 5 seconds of time since last user input when there is a period of inactivity lasting at least 15 seconds.<br><br>Suggested metadata:<br>M1: # mouse clicks<br>M2: # keypresses<br>M3: # function keys used<br>M4: # macros invoked<br>M5: # inactive times included<br>M6: # minutes used in patient room<br>M7: # minutes used remotely (e.g. home, coffee shop) |
